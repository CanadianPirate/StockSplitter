# StockSplitter

**Now Features a simple GUI for ease of use

This script will require yfinance and lxml installed to run, in the future a packaged version will be made for ease of use.

Stocksplitter is a script designed to find as close to an even split in total value when buying multiple stocks as possible given:
* The amount to invest
* The tickers of the stocks they would like to invest in

Some later features may include:
* User entered percentages for each stock
